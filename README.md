## Testing üë®‚Äçüî¨

All testing was carried out in my [TESTING.md](/TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment üöÄ

Deploying your project correctly ensures that it runs smoothly in a production environment. Below are detailed instructions for deploying Level Lounge to Heroku, and how to fork and clone the repository for development or customization purposes.

### Deploy to Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications. Here‚Äôs how to deploy Level Lounge to Heroku:

1. **Set Up Your Heroku Account**:
   - Create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) if you haven't already.
   - Install the Heroku CLI on your machine: [Heroku CLI Installation Guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

2. **Prepare Your Application for Deployment**:
   - Ensure all your dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and that your `Procfile` is correctly configured:
     ```
     web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Set environment variables for `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and database settings. This is crucial for security and proper operation.
   - Never set `DEBUG=True` in production as it exposes sensitive data. Ensure `DEBUG=False` in production settings.
   - Use a `.env` file locally and configure variables in Heroku‚Äôs settings:
     - In your `.env` file:
       ```
       DEBUG=False
       SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
       DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
       ```
   - On Heroku, set these variables through the Heroku Dashboard under **Settings > Config Vars** or using the Heroku CLI.

4. **Collect Static Files**:
   - If your application uses static files, ensure they are collected and served correctly:
     ```bash
     python manage.py collectstatic
     ```

5. **Deploy Your Application**:
   - Go to the **Deploy** tab in your Heroku app dashboard.
   - Under **Deployment method**, connect your GitHub repository to Heroku.
   - Scroll down to the **Manual deploy** section and select the branch you want to deploy (typically `main`).
   - Click **Deploy Branch**. Heroku will automatically build and deploy your app based on the selected branch.

6. **Check Your Deployment**:
   - Visit your deployed app at `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com` to ensure everything is working correctly.

### Forking the Repository

Forking a repository allows you to create a personal copy of someone else's project on GitHub, which you can modify without affecting the original. Here's how to fork the Level Lounge repository:

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork.
   - Click the **Fork** button at the top right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   - After forking, clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git
     ```
   - Change into the cloned directory:
     ```bash
     cd your-forked-repo
     ```

3. **Set Up Upstream Remote**:
   - To keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository, add the upstream remote:
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author/original-repo.git
     ```
   - Fetch the latest changes from upstream:
     ```bash
     git fetch upstream
     ```
   - Merge upstream changes into your local fork:
     ```bash
     git merge upstream/main
     ```

### Cloning the Repository

Cloning a repository allows you to create a local copy of a project from GitHub. Follow these steps to clone the Level Lounge repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository page you want to clone.
   - Click the **Code** button and copy the URL (HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI).
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
     ```
   - Replace `https://github.com/username/repo-name.git` with the URL you copied.

2. **Set Up Your Local Environment**:
   - Navigate into the cloned directory:
     ```bash
     cd repo-name
     ```
   - Install all dependencies using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Set up environment variables in a `.env` file for local development:
     ```
     DEBUG=True
     SECRET_KEY=your_local_secret_key
     DATABASE_URL=your_local_database_url
     ```

3. **Run Migrations and Start the Server**:
   - Run migrations to set up the database:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - Start the local server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your local version of the app running.

---

These detailed deployment steps ensure that your application is securely set up, running correctly, and easily forked or cloned for further development or customization. Always double-check your environment configurations, particularly `DEBUG` and secret keys, to maintain security and proper operation in production environments.
