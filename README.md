### Site Goals

The primary goal of Level Lounge is to foster a vibrant and interactive community centered around gaming discussions, reviews, and shared experiences. The site aims to provide a safe and moderated space where users can express their opinions, ask questions, and connect with like-minded individuals. By offering a range of features such as customizable user profiles, threaded discussions, and engaging content, Level Lounge seeks to build a loyal user base that values thoughtful dialogue and constructive feedback. The platform aspires to grow into a leading gaming forum that not only meets the needs of its current users but also attracts new members through continuous feature enhancements, excellent user support, and a commitment to community-driven content.

## Design üé®

The design of Level Lounge is centered around creating an engaging, user-friendly, and visually appealing environment that reflects the vibrant nature of the gaming community. The color palette uses a bold combination of gold (#ffd700) and dark tones, including deep grays and blues, to create a striking contrast that captures attention while maintaining a modern, sleek aesthetic. This design choice not only enhances the visual appeal but also improves readability, providing a comfortable browsing experience across all devices.

### **Design Principles and Thought Process**
- **Consistency**: Consistent use of colors, fonts, and button styles across all pages ensures a cohesive look and feel. This consistency helps users navigate intuitively, making interactions predictable and reducing cognitive load.
  
- **Contrast and Visual Hierarchy**: The high contrast between the bold gold and dark background elements establishes a clear visual hierarchy, guiding the user's eye naturally to important elements like navigation buttons, headings, and call-to-action links. This approach helps users quickly find what they‚Äôre looking for, enhancing overall usability.

- **Accessibility**: Accessibility was a key consideration, with a focus on clear fonts, appropriate contrast ratios, and a layout that supports screen readers and keyboard navigation. The design ensures that all users, including those with visual impairments, can easily access and interact with the content.

- **User-Centric Layouts**: Pages are designed with the user journey in mind. The landing page presents a welcoming introduction with clear navigation options, encouraging exploration of the forum. Profile pages are personalized, showcasing user details, bio, and contributions in an organized and visually appealing manner. The layout emphasizes ease of use, keeping the user‚Äôs needs at the forefront.

- **Responsive Design**: The design is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. This responsiveness ensures that the forum is accessible and functional across all devices, providing a consistent user experience.

### **Why the UX is Good**
The user experience is at the heart of Level Lounge‚Äôs design. By prioritizing readability, accessibility, and intuitive navigation, the site provides a welcoming environment that encourages user engagement. The clean, structured layouts reduce clutter, making it easy for users to find information, contribute to discussions, and manage their profiles. The vibrant color scheme reflects the energy of the gaming community, creating a fun yet professional atmosphere that appeals to a broad audience. Overall, the design choices support a user-centric approach, ensuring that Level Lounge is not just a forum, but a community space where users feel comfortable and motivated to participate.

### Color Scheme 

The color scheme of Level Lounge is designed to create an inviting and energetic atmosphere that reflects the vibrant world of gaming. Dominated by shades of gold, navy and gray the theme evokes warmth, enthusiasm, and a sense of adventure, making every interaction feel dynamic and engaging. This bright and bold palette not only enhances readability but also brings a touch of excitement to the forum, encouraging users to explore and participate. The color scheme is carefully balanced to ensure that important elements like buttons, links, and notifications stand out, guiding users intuitively through the platform while maintaining a cohesive and visually appealing experience.

## Planningüß¨

### WireFrames

The initial wireframes for Level Lounge were created to guide the development of the site‚Äôs layout, navigation, and overall user interface. The designs included key pages such as Home, Forum, User Profile, and Login, with both desktop and mobile variations considered. As the project evolved, some artistic changes were made to enhance the visual appeal and functionality, aligning the design closer to the site‚Äôs vibrant gaming community theme. Notably, the About page was integrated into the landing page‚Äôs welcome message, as it was determined that a separate About page was unnecessary, streamlining the user experience.

### Desktop Wireframes

### Agile Methodology

The Agile Methodology was employed throughout the development of Level Lounge to ensure a structured and efficient workflow. This approach facilitated iterative progress, regular feedback loops, and the prioritization of key features to meet project goals within the set deadlines. The development process was organized into sprints, identified by user story names such as S1, S2, etc., which effectively served as milestones for the project.

The project was broken down into milestones that marked significant phases of development, ensuring that key objectives were met on time and in the correct order. Milestones helped track progress and served as checkpoints for reviewing completed work before moving forward.

- <details><summary>Milestones</summary>
  <img src="docs/planning/agile/milestones.png"></details>

#### Epics

Epics were used to group related user stories and tasks into larger units of work, making it easier to manage and prioritize features that spanned multiple sprints. Each epic represented a major component of the project, such as user authentication or forum functionality.

  <img src="docs/planning/agile/epics.png"></details>

#### Issues

Issues were logged in GitHub to track tasks, bugs, and enhancements throughout the project. These issues were essential for managing the workload, assigning tasks, and maintaining a clear record of progress.

- <details><summary>Issue Criteria and Tasks</summary>
  <img src="docs/planning/agile/issue-criteria-tasks.png"></details>

#### MoSCoW

The MoSCoW method was used to organize and prioritize tasks into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have categories. A key learning experience was the realization that too many tasks were categorized as Must Haves, focusing heavily on the core functionality of a well-working forum. This left little time to implement Should Have or Could Have tasks, highlighting the importance of balancing priorities. Ideally, Must Haves should not take up more than 60% of any sprint.

- <details><summary>MoSCoW Method</summary>
  <img src="docs/planning/agile/moscow-method.png"></details>

#### Fibonacci Scale

The Fibonacci Scale was used for task estimation, assigning point values to user stories based on their complexity and effort required. This approach helped ensure that the workload was manageable within each sprint and that tasks were realistically planned.

- <details><summary>Fibonacci Scale</summary>
  <img src="docs/planning/agile/fibonacci.png"></details>

#### Kanban Board

The Kanban Board was utilized to visually track the status of tasks from To Do, In Progress, to Done. This board provided a clear and dynamic view of the project‚Äôs progress, helping to keep the team on track and ensuring that tasks were completed in an organized manner.
